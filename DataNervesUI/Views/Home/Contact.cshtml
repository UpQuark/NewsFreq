    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
        This application was developed as an independent project in the hopes of providing an easy-to-use window into the trends in 
        media reporting that have an overwhelming effect on our culture, politics, and lives.
    </p>
    <h3>The developer</h3>
    <p>
        I'm Sam Ennis, a recent college graduate working professionally as a software engineer in healthcare informatics. In my spare time,
        when I actually use it productively, I enjoy working on statistical and quantitative methods-based projects such as this one.
